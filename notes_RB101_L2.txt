Things to learn:
- program procedurally (Ruby syntax etc)
- object oriented programming
- diff topics

code vs programming
- step 1, akin to learning a language, basic grammar and vocab (lower level)
- step 2, building apps and prob solving (higher level)

Difficult to think at mulitple levels of hierarchy for beginners, 'jumping between layers'
--> use pseudo code to map out logic before writing code

pseudo code example below:

if total cards > 21
  then I busted
otherwise,
  I hit or
  I stay

Ok to write small portion of code in pseudocode, then verify logic is sound before going too far

reading stack trace to find right text to share with others who can help e.g. forums or stackoverflow

will notice pattersn in error message, take time to study them

look at rubydocs not rails documentation

there is a right way to ask questions which Chris described and reference is avilable on the Launch School website (e.g. use context etc)

push files to Github regularly esepcially before asking a qestion since that code is likely to be pulled down by TA in order to assist with questions
